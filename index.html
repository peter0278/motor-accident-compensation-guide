<h2>Understanding the Queensland CTP Scheme</h2>

<p>The Compulsory Third Party (CTP) scheme is a mandatory insurance policy attached to the registration of every motor vehicle in Queensland.</p>

<h3>What is CTP?</h3>
<p>CTP insurance indemnifies vehicle owners and drivers who are legally liable for personal injury to another person. It covers personal injury only and does not cover vehicle or property damage.</p>

<h3>Who is Covered?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drivers (not fully at fault)</li>
<li>Passengers</li>
<li>Pedestrians</li>
<li>Cyclists</li>
<li>Motorcyclists</li>
<li>Pillion passengers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Immediate Steps After a Motor Vehicle Accident</h2>

<h3>1. At the Scene</h3>
<p>Your priority is safety, but once the danger has passed, gather evidence including photos, witness details, and driver information.</p>

<h3>2. Seek Medical Attention Immediately</h3>
<p>Medical documentation creates the legal link between the accident and your injuries.</p>

<h3>3. Reporting to Police</h3>
<p>You must report the crash to police and obtain a Police Report Number before lodging a CTP claim.</p>

<h2>Motorcycle Accident Claims: A Unique Category</h2>

<p>Riders face significantly higher injury risks and claims often involve higher compensation due to the severity of injuries.</p>
